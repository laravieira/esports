# NLW 9 - eSports

This is the final version on the [NLW 9 - eSports](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/event/nlw-09/ignite) during the event.

This will not be updated, is minted to save the state of the project when I finish the NLW.

To see all that was done after the NLW week, go to the [master](https://github.com/laravieira/esports/tree/master) branch.
